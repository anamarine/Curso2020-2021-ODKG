# Data Requirements
## Selected Datasets
[Contractual activity 2020 - Madrid City Council](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=139afaf464830510VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&reloadCaptcha=true")

[General data about City District Boards](https://datos.madrid.es/sites/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=a73ecfba69326410VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD)

### Description:
Basic data of the contracts awarded in 2020 by the different Public Administrations and other public sector entities subject to the aforementioned regulations. It includes, among other data, the contracting entity, the type of contract, the contract and advertisement data, and the link to the documentation.

Also, a dataset about about City District Boards is included. Relevant information abaut tose entities (such as contact information, address...) can be found in this dataset.

The use of the second dataset (district boards) complements the contact information for those contracts that have District Boards act as contractor entities. That is why the merge of both datasets is interesting.

Data is divided in two datasets:

- Contractual activity 2020- Madrid City Council
- General data about City District Boards
